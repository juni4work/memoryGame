## Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable, reproducible problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest develop branch in the repository.

Isolate the problem - you NEED to provide a live example — ideally also create a reduced test case. This CodePen, JSFiddle and JS Bin are helpful templates you can fork or clone.
